  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective Date: 11th May 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Zen Ball Sort</strong> (the “App”) is a family-friendly mobile game. While you can play without creating an account, optional Google Sign-In enables social features like leaderboards, achievements, and saving progress. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No mandatory personal data:</strong> You can play the App without providing any personal information. There are no required logins or registrations to use the core gameplay.</li>

    <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> When you sign in using your Google account, we may access your basic profile information (such as your display name and email) to enable features like achievements, leaderboards, and saving your game progress across devices. We do not collect passwords or sensitive personal data. This data is used solely for game functionality and is not shared outside Google Play services.</li>

    <li><strong>Non-personal device information:</strong> We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect aggregate usage data such as number of levels played, session length, crash reports, and basic device info (device model, OS version). This data is anonymous and is used only to help us improve the game’s performance and stability.</li>

    <li><strong>Advertising data:</strong> The App shows ads served by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect a unique Android advertising ID (AAID) from your device to show ads and measure ad performance. This ID is anonymous and resettable by you. We do not receive your name, email, or any personal info from the ads. We have enabled child-protection settings on AdMob, so personalized ads are disabled for users identified as children.</li>

    <li><strong>No sensitive permissions:</strong> The App does not access your location, contacts, camera, microphone, or other sensitive sensors. It only uses internet access (network) to download ads and synchronize game progress. Internet access is a normal permission that does not involve personal data by itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Game improvements:</strong> Usage analytics (from Firebase) helps us understand how people play the game so we can fix bugs and plan new features. This data is used in aggregate only, not tied to you as an individual.</li>

    <li><strong>Ads:</strong> Ad data (via AdMob) is used to load and display ads and to track ad impressions/earnings. We rely on Google’s ad platform policies; we do not share your data outside the Google advertising ecosystem. Your anonymous ad ID is only used for relevant ads and performance stats, not for building a personal profile.</li>

    <li><strong>Game progress and social features:</strong> If you sign in with Google, we use your account to save your progress, access leaderboards, and unlock achievements. This helps enhance your game experience. We do not use your account for marketing or share your identity outside Google Play services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics (Google) to collect the usage metrics mentioned above. Firebase Analytics may collect limited technical information (e.g. device model, OS version, app version) as part of its standard analytics. See Firebase’s privacy notice for details.</li>

    <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> We use Google AdMob for ads. AdMob may collect information like AAID and limited ad performance data. AdMob does not get any personal data (unless you explicitly provide it through an ad). See Google’s AdMob privacy for details.</li>

    <li><strong>Google Play Games Services:</strong> We use Google Play Games for achievements, leaderboards, and cloud save. These services access your Google account only when you choose to sign in. Google Play Games' data usage is governed by Google’s privacy policy.</li>

    <li><strong>Data sharing:</strong> We do not sell or rent your data. We may share aggregated, non-identifying usage statistics with service providers (Firebase, AdMob, Google Play Games) to support their services. Any data sharing is governed by those providers’ policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy (COPPA)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>General audience:</strong> Zen Ball Sort is suitable for all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. No names, emails, photos, or other personal data are collected in the App unless Google Sign-In is used.</li>

    <li><strong>Advertising to kids:</strong> If the App is determined to be child-directed, we comply with applicable laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We have configured AdMob to treat all ads as child-directed: this disables personalized or interest-based ads. Ads shown to children will be age-appropriate.</li>

    <li><strong>Google Sign-In for kids:</strong> We do not require Google Sign-In to play the game. For users identified as children, Google restricts sign-in access and disables features like leaderboards and achievements as per their policies. We comply with these restrictions.</li>

    <li><strong>Parental controls:</strong> Parents should monitor their children’s use of any app. We recommend enabling Android’s parental controls and supervision tools if desired.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Analytics opt-out:</strong> You can opt out of Firebase analytics by disabling “Usage & diagnostics” or similar options in your Android settings (this stops anonymous analytics data collection).</li>

    <li><strong>Ad ID reset:</strong> You may reset your device’s Advertising ID or use the Android “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting to limit ad tracking.</li>

    <li><strong>Data deletion:</strong> Although we don’t store personal accounts or identifiable data, if you have specific concerns or requests (e.g. remove your anonymous analytics data from our logs), please contact us as described below.</li>

    <li><strong>Policy updates:</strong> We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our practices. The current version will always be available on our website or app. Significant changes will be highlighted in the app’s “What’s New” notes.</li>
  </ul>
