  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective Date: 11th May 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Ball Sort</strong> (the “App”) is a family-friendly mobile game with no user accounts or social features. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No personal data collected:</strong> We do not require any personal information (name, email, address, etc.) to use the App. There are no logins or registrations.</li>

    <li><strong>Non-personal device information:</strong> We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect aggregate usage data such as number of levels played, session length, crash reports, and basic device info (device model, OS version). This data is anonymous and is used only to help us improve the game’s performance and stability.</li>

    <li><strong>Advertising data:</strong> The App shows ads served by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect a unique Android advertising ID (AAID) from your device to show ads and measure ad performance. This ID is anonymous and resettable by you. We do not receive your name, email, or any personal info from the ads. We have enabled child-protection settings on AdMob, so personalized ads are disabled for users identified as children.</li>

    <li><strong>No sensitive permissions:</strong> The App does not access your location, contacts, camera, microphone, or other sensitive sensors. It only uses internet access (network) to download ads. Internet access is a normal permission that does not involve personal data by itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Game improvements:</strong> Usage analytics (from Firebase) helps us understand how people play the game so we can fix bugs and plan new features. This data is used in aggregate only, not tied to you as an individual.</li>

    <li><strong>Ads:</strong> Ad data (via AdMob) is used to load and display ads and to track ad impressions/earnings. We rely on Google’s ad platform policies; we do not share your data outside the Google advertising ecosystem. Your anonymous ad ID is only used for relevant ads and performance stats, not for building a personal profile.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics (Google) to collect the usage metrics mentioned above. Firebase Analytics may collect limited technical information (e.g. device model, OS version, app version) as part of its standard analytics. See Firebase’s privacy notice for details.</li>

    <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> We use Google AdMob for ads. AdMob may collect information like AAID and limited ad performance data. AdMob does not get any personal data (unless you explicitly provide it through an ad). See Google’s AdMob privacy for details.</li>

    <li><strong>Data sharing:</strong> We do not sell or rent your data. We may share aggregated, non-identifying usage statistics with service providers (Firebase, AdMob) to support their services. Any data sharing is governed by those providers’ policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy (COPPA)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>General audience:</strong> Ball Sort is suitable for all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. No names, emails, photos, or other personal data are collected in the App.</li>

    <li><strong>Advertising to kids:</strong> If the App is determined to be child-directed, we comply with applicable laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We have configured AdMob to treat all ads as child-directed: this disables personalized or interest-based ads. Ads shown to children will be age-appropriate.</li>

    <li><strong>Parental controls:</strong> Parents should monitor their children’s use of any app. We recommend enabling Android’s parental controls and supervision tools if desired.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Analytics opt-out:</strong> You can opt out of Firebase analytics by disabling “Usage & diagnostics” or similar options in your Android settings (this stops anonymous analytics data collection).</li>

    <li><strong>Ad ID reset:</strong> You may reset your device’s Advertising ID or use the Android “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting to limit ad tracking.</li>

    <li><strong>Data deletion:</strong> Although we don’t store personal accounts or identifiable data, if you have specific concerns or requests (e.g. remove your anonymous analytics data from our logs), please contact us as described below.</li>

    <li><strong>Policy updates:</strong> We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our practices. The current version will always be available on our website or app. Significant changes will be highlighted in the app’s “What’s New” notes.</li>
  </ul>
